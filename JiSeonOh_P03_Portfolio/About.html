        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <h4>Ji Seon Oh</h4>
        <p>UX/UI Designer</p>
        <p>I am an enthusiastic designer and a third-year student
  studying design in Interactive Arts and Technology School
  at Simon Fraser University. I have always been interested
  in and passionate about finding and solving design problems
  around us. As I have been working on numerous design
  projects such as mobile app development and web design
  development based on user experiences, I have learned
  about the importance of user experience. User experience
  is essential for the design to make more profitable and
  attractive. Every time I design something, considering
  the user experiences is the first step that I do. As a user
  experience designer, both aesthetics and usability are
  very important values to me.</p>

        <p>By accomplishing the projects, I am professional in Adobe illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Also, I am familiar with HTML, CSS and java languges by creating websites and games/applications. I have some experience in filming by using Adobe Premier Pro and Adobe After Effects.</p>
