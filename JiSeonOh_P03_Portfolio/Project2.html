          <p>During a course in SIAT's Human-Computer Interaction, we were asked to redesign a social messenger interface with new color schemes based on the current design problem of the messenger.</p>

        <h3>ISSUE</h3>
        <p>First of all, I found current design problems in the Facebook messenger. When I considered the issue of color-blindness and the influence of the background, the color choice on the color palette was quite limited. Therefore, to deal with the limitations on the color palette, I altered the color of the interface of the Facebook Messenger, with a new look that would support the users to interact with the application even in a low light situation, such as sitting in the back seat of a car at dusk. </p>

        <h3>COLOR SCHEME</h3>
        <img class="color" src="img/color2.jpg" alt"color scheme">
        <p>The color I chose specifically for the background of the interface is dark gray, as it would make it easier on our eyes to interact with the phone in an environment that is not fully dark but is already dimly lit. I also changed the color of the conversation bubbles into two different shades of gray to increase the contrast between colors as a way to avoid a subtle color difference in the design of the interface. I managed to maintain a high contrast between colors and we used shades of the two distinctive colors to create a strong signal on only one color-opponent channel so that our visual systems could easily distinguish them.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, another reason why I chose to use dark gray as the background and light gray for the text in the foreground is because I tried to avoid colors that color-blind people are not able to distinguish. These color adjustment would be ideal for the twilight time since it is not too bright and yet not too dark.</p>

        <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
        <p>There would be less strain on the eyes, and the users would feel more comfortable and be able to interact with the application while they are in the low light settings. By re-adjusting the color of this messaging application, I was targeting at cellphone users who are constantly on their cellphones all day long, especially for those who use their cellphones in low light situations.</p>
